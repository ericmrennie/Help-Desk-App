Users can submit their help desk tickets by entering their information along with the issue. Upon successful submission, a snackbar notification appears at the bottom of the screen, confirming that the ticket has been successfully submitted. If the submission is unsuccessful, a snackbar notification will inform the user of the failure.

On the admin side, thereâ€™s an intuitive layout that displays each help desk ticket as a card. These cards include the engineer's name, email, and the ticket's status, which defaults to 'New' upon submission. By pressing the 'View Details' button, administrators can drill down into the ticket via a modal, update the status, and enter a response.
