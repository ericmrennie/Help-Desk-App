# Help-Desk-App

Stack: React, Node.js, Express, MongoDB

Users can easily submit help desk tickets by providing their information and a description of the issue. A snackbar notification confirms successful submissions or alerts users to any errors.
 
Administrators benefit from a user-friendly interface displaying tickets as cards, each showing the engineer's name, email, and the ticket's status (defaulting to 'New' upon submission). With the 'View Details' button, admins can access ticket details through a modal, update statuses, and provide responses efficiently.
